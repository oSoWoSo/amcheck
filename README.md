This repo will include Github Actions YAML files.
Used by "AM": The package manager for AppImage packages and other portable apps for GNU/Linux.

### ["AM" Application Manager](https://github.com/ivan-hc/AM)

# Included actions:
 - Clean Main History: Create main-clean branch with cleaned history
 - Check variables in 250 apps
 - Sync AppImages listing: If programs are changed, will update appimages listings
 - Test random 💯 apps: Test if installation scripts working correctly

All actions work (mostly) in another repo (AM)

Usually will be triggered by automation

Or using repository_dispatch,

aka
